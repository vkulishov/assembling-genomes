Week 3 has 6 tasks.

Problem 1:
Finding a Circulation in a Network

Task: Given a network with lower bounds and capacities on edges, find a circulation if it exists.

Input: Input Format. The first line contains integers 𝑛 and 𝑚 — the number of vertices and the number of edges,
       respectively. Each of the following 𝑚 lines specifies an edge in the format “u v l c”: the edge (𝑢, 𝑣)
       has a lower bound 𝑙 and a capacity 𝑐. (As usual, we assume that the vertices of the network are
       {1, 2, . . . , 𝑛}.) The network does not contain self-loops, but may contain parallel edges

Output Format. If there exists a circulation, output YES in the first line. In each of the next 𝑚 lines output
the value of the flow along an edge (assuming the same order of edges as in the input). If there is no
circulation, output NO.
