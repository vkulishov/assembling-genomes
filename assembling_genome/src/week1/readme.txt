Week 1 has 2 tasks.

Problem 1:
Assembling the phi X174 Genome from Error-Free Reads Using Overlap Graphs

Task. Given a list of error-free reads, perform the task of Genome Assembly and return the circular genome
from which they came.

Dataset. Each of 1 618 lines of the input contains a single read, that is, a string over {A, C, G, T}. The reads are given to you in alphabetical order because their true order is hidden from you. Each read
is 100 nucleotides long and contains no sequencing errors. Note that you are not given the 100-mer composition of the genome, i.e., some 100-mers may be missing.

Output. Output the assembled genome on a single line.
